    <pre id ="Abstract_InText">
      This article’s aim is to see if quantum sensors are a plausible next step in navigation, considering the upsides and downsides of them, in comparison to conventional inertia sensors. 
        As well as the analysis of an experiment carried out comparing the two.

    <h3 id="Introduction"Introduction</h3>
    <pre id ="Introduction_InText">
      Currently, most marine vehicles use inertial sensors and gyroscopes to track acceleration, rotation and overall orientation of objects. 
        However, such sensor’s performance degrades over time due to what is called drift, requiring constant calibration to keep good accuracy. 
        Loss of accuracy could be very detrimental at sea as it would deteriorate safety and performance of the vessel. 
        The use of quantum sensors could mitigate this problem entirely.
    </pre>

    <h3 id="Section 1">Conventional inertia sensors and drift.</h3>
        <p id ="Section1_InText">
            An inertial navigation system uses accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure linear acceleration and angular velocity, 
            then uses the data it collects over time to calculate the navigational data of the vessel (Woodman 2007). 
            Because this data collected over a long period of time, even very small measurement errors pile on exponentially, 
            increasing the deviation of the reading from the true value over time (Hou et al. 2025; Woodman 2007). 
            These errors can be cause in inertial sensors by bias instability, scale-factor variation,
            temperature sensitivity, and electronic noise, which all slowly degrade the device’s accuracy, especially over long use durations (Blum 2023). 
            These inaccuracies make inertial-only navigation very unreliable without regular external correction or calibration, 
            which is why INS is often paired with external sources like a satellite (GNSS) to provide corrections on the go. (Kok et al. 2020) 
        </p>
    <h3 id="Section 2">Quantum sensors. Advantages and Principles</h3>
        <p id ="Section2_InText">
            Quantum sensors represent a new class of navigation instruments that rely on the behaviour of atoms rather than mechanical components to measure acceleration, rotation, or gravity. 
            One of the most used approaches is cold-atom interferometry, in which atoms are cooled and then manipulated with laser pulses so that their wave-like behaviour can be used to detect subtle changes in motion 
            or gravitational fields, using this data to calculate trajectory and coordinates of the vessel. 
            Unlike classical inertial sensors, whose performance depends on the precision of manufactured components, atoms of the same material are identical by nature and do not experience mechanical wear. 
            This gives quantum sensors the potential for long-term stability with far smaller or even non existent drift (Lellouch & Holynski 2025).
            Recent research and sea trials have demonstrated the practical benefits of the sensors for marine navigation. 
            The Royal Navy has shown that prototype quantum devices can output correct data even in environments where satellite or GPS signals are limited or intentionally jammed (Royal Navy 2024). 
            Because quantum sensors can measure real physical quantities rather than relying purely on the use of past motion, they offer a reliable way of reducing cumulative error during long usage.
        </p>
    <h3 id="Section 3">Comparison analysis.</h3>
        <p id ="Section3_InText">
            Gravity-map matching is a good way of navigation, where local values in gravity are compared to an already existing database. 
            Gravity map matching has been demonstrated using conventional accelerometers, but it remains challenging due to the low fluctuations in gravity that the hardware is expected to record (Tall 2024). 
            An experiment carried out by (Bidel et al. 2018), provides a comparison of Atom gravimeter (An example of a vessel-borne quantum sensor) and a traditional spring gravimeter 
            (A sensor which uses a satellite for corrections) From the table produced after the experiment we can gather this information: 
            The Atom gravimeter in the Calibration stages of the experiment has a much lower mean error (4.5 times more accurate) as well as lower standard deviation, which would suggest higher stability 
            (1.8 times more stable) compared to a spring gravimeter. The study was able to achieve sub-mGal ship-borne gravity measurements, which is lower than 0.00001ms^(-2) acceleration reading precision or 
            gravity reading precision. Allowing for a potential to have sensors with no to zero drift as well as no requirement for calibration. 
            Following on, as the atom gravimeter is ship-borne that would mean the vessel containing this sensor does not need to rely on an external hardware to correct its readings, further improving reliability. 
        </p>
    <h3 id="Section 4">Limitations.</h3>
        <p id ="Section4_InText">
            Despite their potential, quantum sensors are still only in early development, and several issues need to be addressed before they can be widely adopted in commercial marine settings. 
            One of the major issues is that the technology used in quantum devices is usually much more complex and sensitive than classical inertial sensors. 
            They require stable laser systems, vacuum chambers, and magnetic shielding, all of which must function well aboard a moving vessel. C
            onstraints on size, weight, and power remain a big issue, especially for platforms such as autonomous underwater vehicles where available space is limited (Tall 2025). 
            Quantum sensors are also strongly affected by environmental noise and vessel motion. Even though laboratory demonstrations show excellent performance, 
            real-world conditions are vastly different from lab once, those conditions can disturb the atomic measurements inside the sensors which in turn would decrease accuracy again. 
            Ongoing research aims to model these effects more accurately, especially for gravity-aided navigation systems, but the conditions are still mostly idealised (Lellouch & Holynski 2025). 
            Furthermore, although experimental trials are increasing, field data remain limited, making it hard to understand if the advantages of quantum sensors over conventional once are as 
            overwhelming as we would expect.
        </p>
    <h3 id="Section 5">Conclusion.</h3>
        <p id ="Section5_InText">
            In conclusion, this paper has highlighted the advantages of quantum sensors over conventional inertia sensors. 
            Outlining that quantum sensors offer much higher resolution, leading to more accuracy and improved reliability. 
            Even though the advantages outweigh the disadvantages, the lack of proper knowledge and technology stalls development and commercial use
